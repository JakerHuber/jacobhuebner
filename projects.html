                    <h4>Dream Journal App</h4>
                    <p>I designed an app that would help people remember their dreams.The goal was to records the user's dream by speech or text once a day during first 30 minutes after waking up. This app was created for my behavioral design class. This class taught me how to design products that actually work instead of creating a product that they think will work. This means that I had to rapidly prototype, test, and resign as i went along.</p>

                    <p>Yeah, the website you're reading this very text from is one of my projects. All of the site code is written by me. I made this whole site using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I followed the Material design guidelines for the website theme. However, I've made a couple creative changes. For this website, I also explored website animation and transitioning. Several elements of the site, such as the homepage cards and the project item grid, use css animations to enhance the experience. It was a fun experience trying something new.</p>

                    <p>In 2017, I got my hands on a old server and switch. I came to the conclusion that I needed a portable rack for my upcoming projects. So I ran over to IKEA and picked up a couple LACK tables. Once the rack was built, I installed VMware ESXi 5.5 on the server. Overall, the project cost me $33.</p>

                    <p>In 2017, I decided that I would build my own personal VPN. I wanted to securely connect to my home network from anywhere. First, I found an old server and switch. Then, I built a server rack out of furniture I bought from IKEA. Next, I downloaded the software I needed from Microsoft Imagine. Finally, I setup the software and configured the virtual network in Azure. Here's a diagram of my point-to-site VPN.</p>

                    <p>In 2017, I took the Capstone for the Computer and Internetworking Technologies Major. The Capstone required students to use all of the skills they learned over the program. The Capstone was to create a fully functional networking with the same functionality of a real business network. For the whole semester, I worked on a team with two other students to build a network. At the end, we had a fully wired cisco network, VMware server running the VMs, windows server for Active Directory, a fully modeled ADDS based off our company, Internet Access, VPN Tunnel, and a webserver.</p>
